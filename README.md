# Chattest

## Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate an application chat-window.
When initially building the simulation, I considered using an
MVC framework such as Angular because of its ease of use when it comes to 
data-binding. I settled with Jquery simply because it seemed like the quickest solution to accomplish the goal.

Next step will be adding a node server to actually implement chat capability.

## Quirk

I also wanted to create a function so that as the chatwindow populates with messages, the scroll/window adjusts to the bottom/last message. I was working on a potential solution but wanted to return the project in a reasonable time.


## Libraries

Jquery and Bootstrap.css were the two open source libraries used to complete this project.

## Thanks

Thanks for taking the time to checkout this project. I'm always open for feedback. Especially if you know of a simple solution to fix the above-mentioned quirk.
